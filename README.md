## Credit Card Customer Behavior Prediction Using Machine Learning

This study explores the prediction of potential credit card customers using classification models like Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Starting with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand and clean the dataset, we proceed to data preprocessing, addressing issues such as missing values and encoding categorical variables. Our focus shifts to training and optimizing models to predict credit card leads effectively. Key steps include standardization, managing class imbalance with SMOTE, and hyperparameter tuning. Performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC_ROC. The final section provides actionable insights and strategies for financial institutions to target credit card leads more accurately, enhancing marketing efficiency.
